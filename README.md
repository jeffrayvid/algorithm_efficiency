Designing efficient algorithms to solve simple computer science problems

These were all exercises from Algorithms Analysis class in Fall 2018. The following is included in the repo:
1) Calculating Fibonacci in exponential, linear, and linear (with constant space) running time
2) Using divide-and-conquer to efficiently find the max profit of when to buy and sell stocks
3) Finding the max subarray within a list using brute force, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming
